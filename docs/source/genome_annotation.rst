.. warning:: Please note, the majority of the content currently on this page is from 2018-2020 when I was working on the *Apostichopus californicus* genome project and may not be correct. I am starting to add/update content as of mid 2022.

Introduction
============

While creating a high quality, contiguous genome assembly is critical to any genomics or genetics project, a genome assembly is practically useless without identifying and characterizing the structural components of a genome such as genes, transposable elements, promoters, transcription factor binding sites, etc. [Further elaboration on the challenge in genome sequencing projects...]
