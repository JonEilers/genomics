Welcome to Analytical Genomics' Tutorials!
===================================

In the upcoming years the number of species with genome assemblies is going to explode. There are an estimated 8.7 million species according to a `2011 study <https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001127&utm_campaign=Au%20fil%20des%20lectures&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter>`_ and each species will need multiple assemblies to generate a `pangenome <https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/37707/1/2020_Book_ThePangenome.pdf#page=98>`_. Recent years have seen genome sequencing projects become more common and accessible. This will only become more true as long read sequencing becomes cheaper. However, the tools and knowledge to assemble and annotate a genome are scattered across scientific papers, github repositories, and academic institutions. 

My goal is to distill the basics into one website that is understandable and accessible in order to encourage scientists and the curious that genome sequencing projects are acheivable without needing wads of cash and a team of scientists. It is my hope that someday sequencing technology and assembly are so accessible that a child or intrepid explorer stumbling across an interesting bug or novel plant phenotype could take it home and submit it for genome sequencing without needing to sell an arm or leg or brave the ivory tower that academics hole up in. 

Here I have detailed the tools I’ve used and the process I go through to create genome assemblies, predict genes, and analyze results. When reading these walk-throughs, keep in mind that it’s a rare day when everything works the first time. More time is spent troubleshooting installation problems and learning how to use a tool than is spent actually using the tool. So if you find yourself struggling to get things working, rest assured, that’s a battle we all fight everyday.

Before diving in though, allow me to share an outline of what
